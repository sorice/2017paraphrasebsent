    "\n",
    "- __Semantic Text Similarity__: Given two sentences you must calculate the degree of similarity and classify them. Usually this is a multi-class problem with 6 classes.\n",
    "- __Textual Entailment__: Identify if two texts are related in one direction (A implicates B).\n",
    "- __Text Similarity__: Given two text fragments you must identify if they are semantically related in both directions.\n",
    "- __Text Alignment__: Given two different texts you must match every sentence in text A with its corresponding sentence in text B.\n",
    "- __Paraphrase Identification__: Given two sentences you must classify if they are paraphrased or not (binary classification).\n",
    "- __Text Reuse__: Detect reused fragments in a single text having a text collection as source.\n",
    "- __Plagiarism Detection__ (_Text Reuse + Citation Analysis_): Detect in a text collection pairs of non-quoted fragments with the same meaning.\n",
    "- __Machine Translation__: Align text pairs with same meaning but in a different language.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this notebook was accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"After having the aligned normalized-texts, a new paraphrase corpus (binary cathegory) was generated, based on  chunks extracted from the xmls of PAN-PC corpus.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "The true cases are generated in the first place. This part of the process is simple and fast, because chunk information is full contained in the xmls of PAN-PC corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the first version of non paraphrased cases (or false cases) must be constructed mathematically due to the lack of information of non-paraphrased xmls of PAN-PC corpus. The second version constructs almost 3 thousand cases based on random selections of offsets and lens of true pairs. This second version is faster and generates more credible cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "For future experiments, the best way to accomplish this task is to generate non-paraphrased pair of texts manually; that is, humanly designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final proposition of this corpus must be to clarify if the selection of fragments is larger than a sentence, is more suitable or has anything to add to the process of plagiarism detection. The possible conclusions after all the machine learning experimentation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Paraphrase Detection phase algorithms get almost perfect accuracy results when they have long data to compare. This fact makes us conclude that the _Search Space Reduction_ stage is more important, because it is responsible for defining the offset and length of reused fragments.\n",
    "- Long reused fragments help with paraphrase because the behavior of the detection changes when paraphrase type changes, this is only possible with 3 or more classes of paraphrase inside _PSTSCorpus_. The recommendation for future experiments is to use the strategy of corpus _Plagiarised_Short_Answers_ (based on 4 degrees of rewriting), or to get a derived classification corpus similar to P4P corpus (which offers more cathegories based on linguistic phenomenon of the change: lexical, same polarity, addition-deletion, etc)."
