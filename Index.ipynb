    "\n",
    "The first phase of this collection shows how to normalize text corpus in python using some very well known international corpus and some basic text similarity scores align fragments of text to build a new corpus of similarity based on paragraph units. The quality of alignment is also evaluated.\n",

    "\n",
    "The second phase shows the potential of Sklearn similarity measures/scores, also a self package for text similarity measure with more than 40 different scores. It is also showed the transformation of the corpus based on similar sentences into vector of similarity scores, more suitable for machine learning experiments.\n",
