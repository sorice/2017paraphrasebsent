Fathy is oeuvre is that of a modern architect schooled in European curricula who took advantage of desert architecture in harmonious and climatically beneficial ways . By incorporating into his designs traditional vernacular devices and proven methods for cooling structures by harnessing natural energy he practiced and taught appropriate technology in a world careening headlong toward wasteful toxic high energy use . Working on behalf of his clients within strict economic limitations he re_introduced environmentally sound techniques such as windcatches cooling towers the mushrabiya window screen interior fountains and the ventilating attributes and air_conditioning principles of the courtyard into his designs of schools houses and entire villages . Fathy also revived a lost method of roofing adobe buildings with domes and Nubian vaults crafted by hand out of sundried bricks smaller in size than wall adobe bricks . All these elements offered solidity beauty cultural and spiritual harmony costing far less than conventional structures of concrete corrugated steel and other industrial materials which require mechanical temperature controls .
