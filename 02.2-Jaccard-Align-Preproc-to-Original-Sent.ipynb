    "The objective of this process was accomplished. The obtained transformed text contains the proposed structure. 1361 pairs of text (cases) were obtaibned previously from the 2000 initial normalized list using initial versions. Then we re-aligned thems to show the process of alignment using 02.2_alignNormalizedCaseList.py script. In the final version of this script we get 2000 pair cases thanks to fine dev of func _normalize()_.\n",

    "Although 2.2 script use the Jaccard alignment algorithm and the 100% of the cases were good aligned after normalization, it is very easy to test other similarity distances or alignment knowleage in a different corpus and obtain different results and performance, based on original_text_corpus particularities."
